NRfamPred: A proteome-scale two level method for prediction of nuclear receptor proteins and their sub-families
Nuclear receptor proteins (NRP) are transcription factor that regulate many vital cellular processes in animal cells. NRPs form a super-family of phylogenetically related proteins and divided into different sub-families on the basis of ligand characteristics and their functions. In the post-genomic era, when new proteins are being added to the database in a high-throughput mode, it becomes imperative to identify new NRPs using information from amino acid sequence alone. In this study we report a SVM based two level prediction systems, NRfamPred, using dipeptide composition of proteins as input. At the 1st level, NRfamPred screens whether the query protein is NRP or non-NRP; if the query protein belongs to NRP class, prediction moves to 2nd level and predicts the sub-family. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we were able to achieve an overall accuracy of 97.88% at the 1st level and an overall accuracy of 98.11% at the 2nd level with dipeptide composition. Benchmarking on independent datasets showed that NRfamPred had comparable accuracy to other existing methods, developed on the same dataset. Our method predicted the existence of 76 NRPs in the human proteome, out of which 14 are novel NRPs. NRfamPred also predicted the sub-families of these 14 NRPs.
